/*
Room provides four different annotations: @Insert, @Update, @Delete and @Query.
For insert and update you can provide OnConflictStrategy value, customizing the behavior
in case of arisen conflict. By default the transaction is aborted, but in our case,
we ignore it. As a parameter of insert(), update() and delete() you can provide a single
object, a few of them or a list. In case you need an id of a newly inserted row(s), just
return long/long[]. For update() you can return int, getting an info of how many rows were affected.
